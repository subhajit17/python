1. To what does a relative path refer?
A relative path refers to the path of a file or directory relative to the current working directory. It does not start with the root directory and is dependent on the current location from which the path is specified.

2. What does an absolute path start with on your operating system?
An absolute path starts with the root directory on the operating system. On most operating systems, such as Windows and Linux, an absolute path typically starts with a drive letter (e.g., `C:\` in Windows) or the root symbol (e.g., `/` in Linux).

3. What do the functions `os.getcwd()` and `os.chdir()` do?
- `os.getcwd()` returns the current working directory as a string. It retrieves the path of the directory from which the Python script or program is being executed.
- `os.chdir()` is used to change the current working directory. It accepts a string argument representing the new directory path and sets it as the current working directory.

4. What are the `.` and `..` folders?
- The `.` folder represents the current directory. It is used to refer to the current location in a file system.
- The `..` folder represents the parent directory. It is used to refer to the directory one level above the current location.

5. In `C:\bacon\eggs\spam.txt`, which part is the dir name, and which part is the base name?
In the path `C:\bacon\eggs\spam.txt`:
- The directory name (dir name) is `C:\bacon\eggs`, which represents the path to the directory containing the file.
- The base name is `spam.txt`, which represents the name of the file itself.

6. What are the three "mode" arguments that can be passed to the `open()` function?
The three mode arguments that can be passed to the `open()` function are:
- `'r'`: Read mode. It opens the file for reading.
- `'w'`: Write mode. It opens the file for writing and truncates the file if it already exists.
- `'a'`: Append mode. It opens the file for writing but appends the new content to the existing content without truncating the file.

7. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?
If an existing file is opened in write mode (`'w'`), the contents of the file are completely overwritten. The file is truncated to zero length, and any existing data is lost. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.

8. How do you tell the difference between `read()` and `readlines()`?
- The `read()` method reads the entire contents of a file as a single string. It returns a string object containing the data from the file.
- The `readlines()` method reads the contents of a file line by line and returns a list of strings, where each element represents a line from the file. Each line string includes the newline character at the end, which can be removed if needed.

9. What data structure does a shelf value resemble?
A shelf value in Python resembles a dictionary data structure. It is a persistent, disk-based dictionary provided by the `shelve` module. It allows you to store and retrieve Python objects using keys. The shelf values are saved to a file on disk, providing a way to persistently store data between program executions.
